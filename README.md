# harvester
Harvester for slurping OA feed data, written in Node.js

This is an upgrade and refactoring of the work carried out creating an [Elasticsearch-based harvester](https://github.com/openactive/openactive-es-example), based on the OpenActive [Ruby feed library](https://github.com/openactive/openactive.rb).
